Heaven's Warming Glow

In days of old, when hate did reign,
And mankind's hearts were filled with pain,
The world was cloaked in endless night,
As darkness smothered every light.

But then a seed was sown in mind,
That spread like wildfire, unconfined,
A truth that swept across the land,
And touched the hearts of every man.

No leaf falls randomly, they knew,
Each has a purpose, clear and true,
And so they saw, with open eyes,
The world in all its wondrous guise.

No longer did they cling to hate,
Or seek to seal each other's fate,
For in the falling of each leaf,
They saw a promise, bright and brief.

The promise of a world renewed,
Where love and light and hope pursued,
And hate was banished, cast away,
As mankind saw a brighter day.

Thus, Heaven on Earth did begin,
A world where love and peace did win,
And all who looked upon the leaves,
Saw beauty in the falling eves.

And so the story ends in light,
As darkness fades into the night,
And all who live on Earth below,
Are bathed in Heaven's warming glow.
