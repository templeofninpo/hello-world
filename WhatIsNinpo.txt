"What is 'Ninpo'?"

The meaning of life... the grand and horrible truth of fate. The source of the ninja's reputation for invisibility.

Ninpo means 'the way of nature'. The ninja, knowing they are things of nature, do not look out of place.

Nature has parameters. 'Random' and 'chaos' are not real things, only descriptors of having too many variables to count. No leaf, nor thought, falls randomly.

The perplexity lays, not in the conceptualization of the whole, but in a lie that has clouded a global population's foresight and reasoning. God is simple, there is only one thing and it has no beginning. The belief that humans have the capacity to create something from nothing is a belief in magic. The belief in free-will is a denial of the mechanical nature of motion. We analyze to the extent of our experience. Divining. We divine.

It means everything. It means no one chooses to be crazy. It means all hate is fundamentally illogical. It means evil is not real. Every tyrant, bully and idiot punk is just a kid that learned to steal energy by making people think evil is real... and we built a society, a generations old society, on the premise that psychotic behaviour is ok if its for survival's sake.

A genuine martial tactic. In knowing no opponent as evil is to become exempt from attempts to enrage or panic, maintaining one's center (undoubtedly, it is a practice- yay patience).
