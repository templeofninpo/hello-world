Wizardry In A Pragmatically Magicless Universe Where Beauty Yet Exists: a general summary of self-awareness

Like novice, journeyman or master 'wizard' is a level of proficiency. Made unique in it's overarching parameter which touches all disciplines.

Rarely attained because it achieves it's grace from acceptance of a grand truth that is contrary to societal and political power.

Humbly, psychotic disciplines, at the point of wizardry attainment, drown in nervous breakdowns (subsequently then mastering redemption... sort of because niceness owns patience and innovation, but I digress).

The more parameters are defined (and refined) the less we conjecture the impossible as possible, which is to say to know what God looks like is to know what God doesn't look like, so to speak.

To understand the significant extent of no leaf falling randomly is to know what you truly are. Life. In this case, life gone nuts upon fire's discovery.

Made blind in the na√Øve belief in human exceptionalism we forgot the wisdom of objective acknowledgement that nothing comes from nowhere (fun fact: this is the Stoicism the Inquisition has tried so hard to eradicate).

To know all is a physical extension of a single beginningless motion is to know everything presenting itself as evil is only ever insane. Bringing an exemption to goading and hostage-taking.

Ever forgiving those who would oppose loving truth most. Steadfast and balanced. Unhatable. Patient.
